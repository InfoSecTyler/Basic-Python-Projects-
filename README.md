Basic Python Projects

<b>Hello!</b> 

My name is Tyler and I'm working to become a Data Scientist using Python!  

This is a collection of all my basic Python aplications and my Python scripts that deal with big data. This serves as my portfolio of coding skills and a tangeable result of my education. 

The applications here are all single-file, but they can vary in complexity and application. All of my projects are ment to be a showcase of basic skills and compentecies, while aiming at creating real world solutions.
